		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>This data release is based on a survey of Ph.D. and non-Ph.D. granting U.S. economics departments for the years 1994-2020 and
2006-2020, respectively. The primary source of data is the annual Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) surveys. CSWEP is a committee of the American Economic Association (AEA). These data are supplemented with data from the AEA's Universal Academic Questionnaire (UAQ)
information when CSWEP data observations are missing for a given institution
and year. Observations that are missing in both CSWEP and UAQ surveys
are imputed using linear interpolation.</p> <p>This study includes variables on the number and composition of faculty, the number of undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. students, and job placement status for Ph.D. graduates. Many of these variables are reported by gender.</p><p>CSWEP has undertaken the collection of data on gender composition of faculty and students in both Ph.D. granting and non-Ph.D. granting U.S. economics departments since 1972.</p></span></p>
